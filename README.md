# shadowplay-unorganizer

Python script to move video files to one place and delete empty folders.

## Description

Nvidia's Instant Replay function automatically sorts replays into folders. This Python script "unorganizes" everything, moving all of the clips to one place. Good for viewing everything by date.
I made this for personal use, but feel free to use it how you'd like.
