# shadowplay-unorganizer

Python script to move video files to one place and delete empty folders.

## Description

Nvidia's Instant Replay function automatically sorts replays into folders. This Python script "unorganizes" everything, moving all of the clips to one place. Good for viewing everything by date or chronologically.

By default it'll dump everything into the same directory that the script is in, but if you want to move the files to another directory, you can just edit the .yaml config file. It also has the ability to omit folders from the unorganizing process.

I made this for personal use, but feel free to use it how you'd like, or if you need a starting point for managing your own files.

## Usage

> Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already

> Place the script into the directory you want to unorganize

> *Optional: move the `unorganizer_config.yaml` into the same directory and edit its contents*

> Open the `run.bat` batch file

> Let the script run

> Done!
